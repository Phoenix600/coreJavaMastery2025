/**
 * ACCESS MODIFIERS
 * ===================
 * 1. default
 * 2. private
 * 3. protected
 * 4. public
 * A. Used for specifying the visibility of members of a class.
 *==========================================================================================
 * A class can have 3 things:
 *  1. Data Members
 *  2. Member Functions
 *  3. Inner Class
 *-
 *  We can use all 3 three access specifiers on these members.
 *  [Imp]:
 *      Outer-class can be only default or public. It can not be private or protected.
 *==========================================================================================
 *
 * There are two ways to use a class.
 *  1. Create the object of class
 *  2. Extend the class inside dummy class and use it.
 *      1. HAS-A -> If a class is used as an object in another class is known as HAS-A relationship.
 *      2. IS-A  -> If a class inheriting the features from previous then is it known as IS-A relationship.
 *      A class can be used by defining the Sub-class by extending from parent.
