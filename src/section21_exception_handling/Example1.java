 * Errors:
 * 	1. Syntax Errors
 * 	2. Logical Errors
 * 	3. Runtime Errors
 *
 * There are two people related to program.
 * 	1. Programmer
 * 	2. User
 *
 * First 2 errors are faced by programmer.
 * Runtime Errors are faced by users. These runtime errors are known as exceptions.
 *
 * Syntax Errors:
 * 	Compiler helps to removes syntax error.
 * Logical Errors:
 * 	If a programmer is compling and trying to run and test the program, program is not giving expected errors. These are very dangerous errors. These errors take a lot of time from programmers.
 * 	Tracing Of Progarm Or Debugger is used for removing logical errors.
 *
 * Runtime Errors:
 * 	Runtime Errors are faced by user.
 * 	User can not remove the errors as user can not make changes.
 * 	Mishandling of program leads to runtime errors.
 * 	1. Invalid Input.
 * 	2. Unavailability Of Resource.
 *
 * 	User will face the problem because of mishandling of program, these are not internal errors of program but
