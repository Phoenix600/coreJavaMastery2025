/**
 * Instructions For You :
 * ‚≠ê Remember:
 *  OOP Principles:
 *      1. Abstraction
 *      2. Encapsulation
 *      3. Inheritance
 *      4. Polymorphism
 *   These principles are common over all modern OOP languages
 *   Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing only required features.
 *   Encapsulation: Grouping all features in a single body.
 *   Inheritance: Borrowing features from previously existing entity and adding some extra features to it. Used for reusing of code.
 *   Polymorphism: Entities which are having similar properties, can be grouped and with single reference.
 *   Specialization = Inheritance
 *   Generalization = Polymorphism
 *   Specialization is inheritance
 *   Generalization is polymorphism
